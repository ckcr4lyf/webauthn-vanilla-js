# Webauth Vanilla JS

Trying to implement Webauthn in Vanilla JS (Frontend).

For the backend we use express for simplicity, but in reality it could be anything, since browserland is the main focus.

## Goals

Try and avoid the complication of the various third party libraries for WebAuthn, and demystify the process of how it works.
